## PART 1 — THE GREEKS: COMPLETE FRAMEWORK

---

### 1.1 CHARM — Apollo's Master Definition & Application

**Apollo's Core Definition:**
> "Charm is Delta Decay with respect to time. BUT although Time is a constant, Volatility is NOT... aka you can prop Deltas up via IV."

**Apollo's Vanna-Charm Relationship:**
> "You have Delta Value; Vanna and Charm are inverse... look at Charm as the Decay part which wants Delta to go to 1 or 0 and Vanna is the part fighting decay to keep it elevated."

> "Vanna wants to prop up the delta.... Charm wants to beat down the delta."

**Apollo's Critical Skew Filter (KEY RULE):**
> "A strong input is how IVs are moving with respect to time. The bearish charm won't effect much with elevated skew. IF skew comes down then you can realize the bearishness... Similar to GEX... Skew down gives you strong momentum to the paradigm."

**Actionable Rule:** Charm direction alone isn't enough. You need **skew to compress** for charm-driven moves to actually materialize. Elevated skew blocks charm effects.

**Simple Jack's Practical Charm Reading:**
- "Charm weakens OTM Deltas and Strengthens ITM deltas."
- "Short calls are bullish charm" (delta going toward 0).
- "The positive charm now is from short OTM calls going towards 0.0 (increasing) and short ITM puts going towards 1.0 (increasing as well)."
- "Put charm and ITM short call charm should keep us well supported unless we get a bad headline."
- "Above a level = charm support; below it = negative charm, negative gamma in size."

**Apollo on Delta Decay Widget (new feature):**
> "This reflects Dealers Hedging so 0dte Delta Decay by strike shows the impact to Options books while the number is the hedging Dealers would have to do spot-wise. Negative (−) means dealers have to sell underlying; positive (+) means dealers have to buy underlying."

> "Delta Decay will help on bias for the BofA and Sidials now."

**Dark Matter's Charm Timeframe Rule:**
> "Charm is always 0DTE." (While vanna and gamma should be checked across multiple timeframes.)

---

### 1.2 VANNA — Advanced Understanding

**Apollo's Term Structure Insight (KEY):**
> "Vanna is quite negative but due to Term structure, there is not really any roll down Vanna to continue bear except near term and near term is backwardation."

> "Vanna has a strong IV side so a ton of the negative Vanna is on farther dated expirations where IV change in 1 day is almost flat. Once IV gets some steepness from Contango, the Negative Vanna will be more bearish as IVs come down with respect to time."

**Translation:** Negative vanna on far-dated expirations doesn't bite unless the term structure is in contango. In backwardation, far-dated negative vanna is dormant.

**Apollo on Vanna & Vol:**
> "I feel like you need to have a strong view on Vol Decay to get a proxy for Vanna."

**Wizard of Ops on Vanna Reflexivity:**
> "Negative vanna isn't so easy because IV is reflexive based on spot movement. The likely activity would be a slight vol crush that might bump us to the upside, but then MM PnL will start to reflect some issues and there will be a selloff. Then reflexively IV will bump."

**Simple Jack's Double-Action Problem:**
> "It's the double-action vanna effect that I have a hard time putting to use... since it involves changes in IV which usually implies a change in spot which then has a feedback to IV from vanna, etc."

**VX Trigger Level — Dark Matter:**
> "VX1 at 20 will trigger negative gamma and vanna gets super volatile too."

**Dark Matter on VX-Vanna Interplay (Jan-Feb 2026):**
> "To the upside it's all about VX and vol — heading into positive vanna but you want to see the VX and vol compress. Not seeing that, so 6960-65 spx have the twin tower weekly positive vannas."

> "Lose 6900 and you have a massive gamma wall as resistance with expanding vol — will bring vanna towards 6875 then 6850."

**Dark Matter on Identifying the Top Greek:**
> "I am starting to hone in on what the 'top' greek of the day is. For me vanna and vol — that's what I have my eyes on right now until vanna has been met."

> "Each greek can push a certain way depending on which one is top. Gamma will provide the structure but we broke it because vanna and vol led the way today."

**Phoenix's Stock Vanna Approach:**
> "I follow like 70 stocks constantly and I know how vanna looks like each day and how they move. I don't trade stocks outside that — I need to follow them for a while."

> "When I found Volland it took me 3 months to understand vanna and I am still learning, adapting, because market changes each year."

---

### 1.3 GAMMA — Structure & Acceleration Zones

**DK5000:**
> "Gamma being negative above the level means price can 'accelerate' in this zone." (Use for entry timing.)

**Wizard of Ops on Negative Gamma Breakouts:**
> "It will propel the move in the short term... but that's a negative gamma zone too, so it can break out with the intent of needing to watch for a good time to sell the rip. That rip is going to be fierce though, so it would feel like trying to catch a rising knife."

**Jettins on VX-Gamma Interaction:**
> "VX1 expansion counters the magnetic hold of the Gamma. In the absence of VX1 expansion, Gamma acts as a repelling orbiting force that can slingshot away when VIX is stable (in either direction)."

> "Because VX1 is expanding, the Gamma on 6900 spx was getting compressed. The continued expansion of VX1 has the side effect of pushing all the red candles out of the vanna chart for the next positive vanna node."

**VIX Compression Required for Breakouts (Jan-Feb confirmed):**
- **Jettins:** "Will need VIX compression to get over to 7000 spx."
- **Dark Matter:** "Positive gamma, vol crush too strong for dealers to not push price back towards 6940-6950."
- **Dark Matter:** "Tough nut to crack. Will take MAJOR vol crush. Even from a gamma standpoint that 6950 level is a tough one to break dealers."

---

### 1.4 DELTA DECAY WIDGET — The New Key Volland Feature (Jan 2026)

**What It Is — Wizard of Ops:**
> "Delta decay shows the current delta hedging needs at expiration. Take the opposite of the sign to get the hedging number."

> "It is in terms of delta — it actually decays as expiration approaches. When t = 0, delta decay is 0."

**How to Read It — Wizard of Ops (KEY RULE):**
> "If there are negative (bullish green) bars flipping to positive (bearish red) as price goes down, there's nothing to stop the drop. If they are green to red, then dealers are working against market momentum and you see a bottom."

> "6900 was the area where delta decay would get more bullish, and acts as support. 6920-6925 is where the red strikes cause markets to get more bearish, acting as resistance. Due to typical put skew, the green bars decay faster than red above."

**When to Use It — Wizard of Ops:**
> "0DTE delta decay is more actionable in the middle of the day. The exposure chart with a charm one right next to it would be great for a scalper."

> "All the 0DTE vanna, charm, and to an extent gamma is captured in the delta decay widget." (Key simplification — one widget captures all.)

> "Towards the end of the day many times you see the delta decay hedging changing BEFORE the market does — a good opportunity to throw on a cheap call or put."

> "I look at short term vanna if I'm making a 0DTE thesis, but doesn't have as much weight as 0DTE Delta Decay."

**Apollo:**
> "Paradigm is AG pure BUT 0dte Delta Decay is +3B." (Delta decay can override/conflict with paradigm signals.)

**Dark Matter's Key Takeaway:**
> "Delta Decay does not tell you WHERE to trade —" (It tells you DIRECTION/BIAS, not entry levels.)

**Wizard of Ops — Combination with Gamma:**
> "If there is bearish or bullish delta decay, but the gamma is negative underneath, a strong movement that reverses that delta decay is possible and worth a lotto."

---

### 1.5 DARK MATTER'S COMPLETE GREEK SCANNING PROTOCOL

> "I am looking at vanna, gamma, delta, and charm. For vanna and gamma: looking at 0DTE, weekly, 2-weeks, 30DTE, and all expiry. Delta: look at the next week of expirations each day including Friday. Charm is always 0DTE."

| Greek | Timeframes Scanned |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Vanna** | 0DTE, Weekly, 2-week, 30DTE, All Expiry |
| **Gamma** | 0DTE, Weekly, 2-week, 30DTE, All Expiry |
| **Delta** | Next week of expirations, each day including Friday |
| **Charm** | 0DTE only |
| **Delta Decay** | 0DTE (mid-day focus) |

---

## PART 2 — PARADIGMS: EXPERT REAL-TIME USAGE

---

### 2.1 BofA Paradigm

- **Wizard of Ops:** "It will be very rare that I will have a bold call or a closing prediction in a BofA paradigm." (BofA = range-bound, level-to-level trading.)
- **Wizard of Ops:** "USDJPY, silver drawdown... Volland is BofA, which means dealers are chilling between the lines in the sand."

### 2.2 GEX Paradigm

- **Apollo:** "A GEX LIS doesn't necessarily mean buy that level.... You really want to see Skew come down OR customers no longer buying puts."
- Skew compression is the confirmation filter for GEX momentum.

### 2.3 Anti-GEX

- **Dark Matter:** "Getting conflicting signals such as AG on 0DTE — 6800spx resistance."
- Watch for delta decay overriding AG signals.

### 2.4 Sidial

- **DK5000:** "Sidial usually comes up when either BofA, GEX, or anti-GEX has run its course and the market is undecided. Sidial messy is really undecided. It behaves more like price consolidation."

### 2.5 Messy Paradigms

- **Abcdefg:** "The widget is messing me up big time today. The amount of times it flashed GEX and BofA..."
- **Apollo:** "Still way too messy for my liking." — Even experts sit out during messy paradigms.
- **LordHelmet:** "Wiz rules are that if paradigm changes, you re-evaluate."

---

## PART 3 — TRADE EXECUTION RULES

---

### 3.1 The Retest Entry Pattern (Most Repeated Setup)

**Dark Matter (TEMPLATE TRADE):**
> "Break past 6875 spx, then break below it — new 30 min candle goes and retests it and you enter on that retest and manage your risk accordingly."

> "Taking the breakdown of 6950spx and then the retest. We broke below 6950spx, popped back to retest it, then had 2 red 30-min candles to test 6935spx."

> "Retests are ALWAYS critical. Especially at a key level like 6950spx. That hints at what is to come."

**Toto:**
> "Wait for 2-way trade, let a range form, let price breakout to the other side, then start looking for retraces."

**Dark Matter on Fakeouts:**
> "Futures is known for fakeouts — I would rather be a few pts late than early and rug pulled."
> "This is why we wait for confirmation of a retest."

---

### 3.2 Wait for Structure to Settle

**Simple Jack:**
> "Especially on days with a lot of noise and high prem at the open, it usually benefits to wait until later part of the day when the structure is well established and most prem has died off... otherwise I find I can be right but still lose. Entry is everything."

**Miyaka:**
> "I am very consistent scalping SPX and I learned few years ago that waiting for things to settle is a huge edge."
> "Waiting for the extremes cuts risk in half."

---

### 3.3 Avoid the Open

**Toto (FULL NQ GUIDE):**
> "Avoid trading the open, sometimes it's best to just wait the full hour until IB (Initial Balance) sets in. The open is basically another binary event that destroys people's accounts, esp on prop. Find an edge on the intraday VP. Take multiple contracts, 10-12 pt stop, widen to 15 if things are crazy. First target should never be less than what you risk. Let your runners run. Track key stats like hold times on winners vs losers."

---

### 3.4 Stop Loss Discipline

- **LordHelmet:** "When I sold 0DTE spreads, I would always set a stop at 2x credit received. That's the only way I would avoid getting blown out even with an 80% WR."
- **Dark Matter:** "6900spx and 6875 SPX. I would keep stop loss tight and wait for a failed breakdown of 6875 if you are taking it."

---

### 3.5 Play Extremes for Reversion

This is the dominant strategy across all experts during volatile, messy periods:

- **Simple Jack:** "Safest way lately: wait and play extremes for reversion."
- **Dark Matter:** "Play the extremes of the zones."
- **LordHelmet:** "Setting alerts for the extremes and walking away until I hear the ding."

---

## PART 4 — TIME-OF-DAY PATTERNS

---

### 4.1 Post-2 PM = "Dealer O'Clock"

**Dark Matter:**
> "Post 2 pm is dealer o'clock where those charm moves can come in. Just note on high volatility days OR where we have an event catalyst, 0DTE data will give way to higher timeframes — i.e. vanna on a weekly timeframe will play a bigger role than 0DTE charm."

### 4.2 Overnight/Futures Session Advantage

**Dark Matter:**
> "The charts between the overnight and RTH session are laughable. So much more chop and randomness in RTH."
> "Why I don't trade most times after lunch. I will wait for futures."
> "The dealer moves overnight are so much more smoother and dead on especially since Trump's admin began."

**Simple Jack:**
> "Overnight is so much calmer — you can catch some nice trends a lot of the time."

### 4.3 Overnight Leading Indicators

- **Dark Matter:** "BTC has been a killer leading indicator overnight. When it dies, ES/NQ are on their way."
- **Dark Matter:** "Past two Sundays we reversed trend. It used to always be up Sundays. Now we have had two Sunday sells."

### 4.4 End-of-Day Opportunities

**Wizard of Ops:**
> "Towards the end of the day you see the delta decay hedging changing before the market does — good opportunity for a cheap call or put."

### 4.5 Event Days Override 0DTE

**Dark Matter:**
> "On high volatility days OR where we have an event catalyst — data release, opex, Trump post/statement — 0DTE data will give way to higher timeframes. Vanna on a weekly timeframe will play a bigger role potentially than 0DTE charm."

---

## PART 5 — OPEX WEEK: SIMPLE JACK'S COMPLETE DEALER PLAYBOOK

---

### 5.1 The Dealer Monetization Logic

> "Dealers are generally long puts in size below us, and short calls on both sides... lean towards seeing days where we dip and rally, but probably head lower into OPEX so they can monetize their puts."

> "With positioning like this where the hedge is long against a short delta position in puts, it makes sense to see a larger sell into expiry as dealers can unwind the hedge and move price favorably at the same time to monetize the positions right as they expire."

### 5.2 How Dealers Manage OPEX Expiry (AM Settlement)

> "They are holding large ITM long puts now. They should be holding a large long hedge against it. Every time they go ITM we see buying, which is probably dealers hedging. All those OPEX positions expire at 9:30 EST when we get the opening print, and dealers need to close their long hedges before/after that."

> "If it were ME, I would wait until the last minute and dump all the long hedges into the open, which would crater price... then the reference print at 9:30 would be most beneficial for monetizing the options, which would instantly expire, leaving me flat."

### 5.3 Post-OPEX Pattern

> "The vol crush after that would just be things returning to normal, once all the OPEX positions get cleared, so I figure the natural course would be a hard rally."

> "Once all that negative delta expires, dealer net delta will go way up, which would imply selling of long hedges."

### 5.4 Dark Matter's OPEX Week Rules

> "Lock in profits during OPEX week. Don't chase breakouts or breakdowns. Wait for failed ones like we have gotten both ways."

> "OPEX weeks are rough. I don't like trading much once I hit a PnL goal. These moves in 15min candles or less will kill you."

---

## PART 6 — VIX/VX1 RELATIONSHIP

---

### 6.1 VX Compression = Bullish / VX Expansion = Bearish

- **Dark Matter:** "Positive gamma, vol crush too strong for dealers to not push price back towards 6940-6950."
- **Dark Matter:** "We keep holding above VX 17 so that is low vol for me."

### 6.2 VX Expansion Changes the Landscape

- **Jettins:** "VX1 expansion counters the magnetic hold of the Gamma. In the absence of VX1 expansion, Gamma acts as a repelling orbiting force that can slingshot away when VIX is stable."
- **Dark Matter:** "Lose 6900 and you have a massive gamma wall as resistance with expanding vol."

### 6.3 VIX Compression Required for Breakouts

- **Jettins:** "Will need VIX compression to get over to 7000 spx."
- **Dark Matter:** "Tough nut to crack. Will take MAJOR vol crush."

### 6.4 Wizard of Ops — "Vixing"

> "I have some theses about how this could get pushed, but either we get an initial vol crush rally that I would be timing with vixing (when it stops undervixing, that's probably a peak)..."

---

## PART 7 — RISK MANAGEMENT & TRADING DISCIPLINE

---

### 7.1 Daily PnL Target — Then Walk Away

- **Dark Matter:** "Layups are so much more fun. Just need to balance how much you trade — which is why I have a PnL target daily. I hit it, I quit, I am out so I can't lose it. On to the next day."
- **Dark Matter:** "You hit that PnL 3-4 times a week, that's the real payout."
- **Dark Matter:** "Green is green — don't overtrade — lock profits — eat steak."
- **Dark Matter:** "My best weeks have been where I hit target and walk away. I set my plan, my targets and entries. I hit, I walk away."

### 7.2 Patience as Edge

- **Phoenix:** "This year it will be all about patience."
- **Phoenix:** "Trying to short all the time is losing money but taking long in right spot is just patience and money."
- **Dark Matter:** "Paytience. Lots of jobs data and then Opex next week. Keep your bias flexible when we are in mean reversion."

### 7.3 Simple Jack's Biggest Confession

> "I wind up with huge up days and push too much, wind up chipping away until I'm down. I always think THIS move is gonna be the big one. Pays so much more to take a portion of the gain and reset, leave the bias aside. We always reverse and get piped."

> "I lose money when I take longer positions and try to day trade around it. It affects your psychology and decisions. I can't be short 1 month and super bullish today. Gotta be all or none."

### 7.4 TheEdge's 15-Year Lesson (Full-Time Trader)

> "Looking back at my trading since inception (15 years now), my p/l would have been way less volatile and profitable if I simply longed, and de-risked at times, instead of trying to be a smart ass and make money from both sides."

> "Being short at the wrong times does a lot of damage to your mental capital."

> "Short the indices is the culprit. Shorting individual names is a way easier game."

### 7.5 Miyaka's Scalping Risk Framework

> "I trade long SPX puts/calls mostly in minutes, taking quick returns on small size per trade so no one trade can make me feel sad for the day. Content with few trades and small consistent daily returns. When it becomes almost robotic — then scale into larger sizes when all stars seem to line up."

> "You can be right only 30–40% of the time and still grow the account if your average win is several times your average loss."

### 7.6 LordHelmet's Volland Transformation

> "Before Volland, I spent a lot of time being underwater and stressed out, getting shaken out of trades that would have been winners, sometimes getting back to even by taking more risk... really bad habits. Now, I have a lot more time and am not really stressed out. I keep a lot more of what I profit from and don't lose very often."

### 7.7 Leverage Warning

- **Apollo:** "People mess up easy trades with leverage."
- **Disciple3:** "I had $500 invested to $12.5k in a month or so... then 1 micro SI liquidated $12k."

---

## PART 8 — PROP FIRM INTELLIGENCE

---

### 8.1 Toto's Brutally Honest Prop Guide

> "The way the drawdowns are setup on props means it's better for most to YOLO them to get over the trailing drawdown asap. If you take standard % risk trades on the evals through the fundeds, it will literally take eons to get taken to live."

> "Most times I'm copytrading from my live accounts to my prop accounts." (Via NinjaTrader — login to multiple props, trades copy from live account.)

> "Sizing well and copytrading multiple props is the way to go."

> "Micros on personal, minis on prop, because I'm a coward."

### 8.2 Prop Payout Rules (Toto)

> "If you make 5k, take 2k out, you have a 3k balance, any amount over 3k will qualify you for payout. They're just asking people to hold a buffer and make money between payouts."

### 8.3 Prop Firm Warnings

| Firm | Warning |
|------|---------|
| **Apex** | "Banned me after taking a large payout, known for screwing traders out of payouts." — Toto. "Steve was denied ~$20k payout." — LordHelmet |
| **FundingTicks** | "Implemented a 1 minute hold time for trades (under 1 min and profits don't count), applied it retroactively." — Toto |
| **TPT** | "TPT screws you because it's intraday trailing." — Toto |
| **Prop influencers** | "I would have more respect if they were transparent about how many they've failed." One influencer has ~1,300 failed evals behind screenshots. — Toto |

### 8.4 LordHelmet's Prop Lesson

> "I realized I was developing bad habits by degen trading in prop. Now I'm experimenting with limiting number of trades per day."

### 8.5 Key Prop Traders in Community

- **Disciple3** — NQ specialist, takes advantage of asymmetric prop risk-reward.
- **Toto** — NQ, copytrading from personal to multiple props.
- **Simple Jack** — Running Topstep combines.
- **LordHelmet** — Primarily micros on brokerage, one prop for experiments.

---

## PART 9 — TECHNICAL TOOLS & CONVERSIONS

---

### 9.1 SPX to ES Conversion

Standard offset throughout the channel: **SPX + 23 ≈ ES level** (varies slightly, was ~20 in Nov, ~23 in Feb).

### 9.2 Fair Value (FV) for SPX-ES

- **Apollo:** "ES to SPX spread is essentially the cost of carry — financing and dividends."
- **CgTrader:** "The Fair Value add at index.arb is very reliable. SPY however is a different animal — requires dynamic percentage conversion."

### 9.3 Volume Profile + Volland

- **Dark Matter:** "Volume profile with Volland is a lethal combo."
- **Dark Matter:** "Go to a daily view of the volume profile. You will see when the options are at the extremes of the VA — High and Low — Ken comes back for his piece."

### 9.4 Sierra Charts & Order Flow

- **Apollo:** "I encourage you to develop in Sierra. There are tons of data points to model and develop algorithms off of."

### 9.5 Volland API

- **Simple Jack:** "I was able to feed in my Volland API, Polygon API, and IBKR API and ask AI to build a framework that they could all talk together — in like an hour it did it all."

---

## PART 10 — DELTA-ADJUSTED GAMMA (Jettins' Discovery)

**Jettins:**
> "5 out of 5 wins. Detail analysis of delta-adjusted-gamma as confirmation to verify which gamma is repelling and which is attractive."

> "With delta-adjusted gamma it appears you can't tell how much of a reaction it will be. However there IS a reaction. Targeting the lowest common denominator appears to have a very high success rate."

> "Delta-adjusted gamma — it's attractive towards 6980 spx and turns resistive closer to 6985 spx."

---

## PART 11 — BIG BILL'S SPREAD SCALPING STRATEGY

> "My thesis is basically that the market isn't moving before the Fed so I am pretty much short iron condors and using the charm regimes, LIS, and Targets to decide when to leg in or out."

> "I am more or less scalping selling 0DTE and 1DTE spreads at the LIS and closing whatever moves my way."

> "More often than not the LIS holds, but if it breaks you get a bigger move."

> "At the open I wrote call spreads for this week and next because Vanna for both weeks were negative, 0DTE charm was positive, and DD was negative."

> "My cents is you just have to be willing to scalp and make sure Charm, Vanna (and sometimes Gamma) line up with your thesis."

---

## PART 12 — VOLLAND PLATFORM ACCURACY & UPDATES

### 12.1 Current Accuracy

**Wizard of Ops:**
> "We get roughly 85% correct, with about 50-60% of the miscalculations being from DOTM legs of spreads (which are mostly meaningless anyway). Once we do spreads, that will be extremely high fidelity."

### 12.2 V2 Matching System

> "We are going to launch a V2 matching system early next year. We have devised a way to accurately match spreads through labeling in the OPRA feed and will deploy it very soon."

### 12.3 Volland Update Schedule

- **Futures session data:** ~2-3 AM EST
- **RTH 0DTE:** Updates after market open
- **OPEX positions:** May drop off overnight widgets, reappear after open

---

## PART 13 — MACRO & EVENT CONTEXT

### 13.1 2026 Volatility Theme (Predicted Nov 2025, Confirmed)

- **Dark Matter (Nov):** "I think next year is going to be more volatile than it has been."
- **Dark Matter (Nov):** "A VIX south of 17 will only be dreamt of IMO."
- **Dark Matter (Jan):** "2026 is going to be volatile as heck. Two-way trading. Make bulls and bears happy."
- **Result:** VX consistently above 17 throughout Jan-Feb 2026. ✅ Confirmed.

### 13.2 Key Event Patterns

- CPI, FOMC, NFP data releases regularly override 0DTE positioning.
- OPEX weeks create "shenanigans" and unusual pinning behavior.
- Trump administration policy announcements cause overnight gaps.
- Tech earnings and AI capex ($200B AMZN) creating market stress.
- Japanese bond yields getting attention as risk catalyst.

---

## PART 14 — WIZARD OF OPS: PHILOSOPHICAL WARNINGS

> "Sometimes, I feel like markets are like putting babies to sleep. Once you think you have it figured out, everything changes. Two people with 'algorithmic strategies' spoke to me today — one just launched and one just ruined. Even in successful times, you have to be sober about what you have."

> "There is a counterparty to your 'system' where if it is worth anything in the first place, they will figure out how to stop losing money."

> "When they come around [patterns], I look to see what causes it. If there is a good reason, it is worth investigating. If they can't say why, it is at best a coincidence."

## MASTER SUMMARY: Top 20 Actionable Rules

1. **Charm needs skew compression to work** — bearish charm in elevated skew does nothing. Wait for skew to come down.
2. **Use Delta Decay for directional bias** — it captures 0DTE vanna, charm, and gamma in one widget. Green-to-red = support; red-to-green = nothing stopping the drop.
3. **Delta Decay can override paradigm signals** — Apollo saw AG paradigm but +3B delta decay (bullish despite bearish paradigm).
4. **Vanna term structure matters** — negative vanna on far-dated expirations is dormant during backwardation. Only activates in contango.
5. **VIX/VX compression is REQUIRED for upside breakouts** — no vol crush = no breakout through major gamma walls.
6. **VX1 at 20 = trigger level** — negative gamma activates and vanna becomes volatile.
7. **Trade retests, not breakouts** — wait for the breakout, then enter on the 30-min candle retest with tight stops.
8. **Wait for structure to settle** — don't trade noise at the open. Wait for IB or until premium dies off.
9. **Post-2 PM = dealer o'clock** — charm moves accelerate. Best 0DTE scalping window.
10. **Identify the "top greek" of the day** — is it vanna driving? Gamma containing? Charm decaying? Trade accordingly.
11. **Event catalysts override 0DTE** — when there's CPI/FOMC/Trump news, weekly vanna matters more than 0DTE charm.
12. **OPEX pattern: sell into AM print → vol crush rally after expiry** — dealers dump long hedges into the open, monetize puts, then market rallies post-clearing.
13. **Dark Matter's scanning: 5 timeframes for vanna/gamma, charm 0DTE only** — systematic approach across all expirations.
14. **Set a daily PnL target and stop** — hit 3-4x/week consistently. Don't give back gains.
15. **BTC leads ES/NQ overnight** — watch BTC for directional clues during futures sessions.
16. **Messy paradigm = sit out or reduce size** — even Apollo and Simple Jack sit out when structure is messy.
17. **Sidial = consolidation** — not directional, treat as range-bound only.
18. **Don't mix swing and day trade positions** — holding overnight bias corrupts intraday decisions.
19. **Overnight futures are smoother** — dealer moves are cleaner with less noise than RTH.
20. **Play extremes for reversion** — the dominant strategy across all experts in volatile regimes.
